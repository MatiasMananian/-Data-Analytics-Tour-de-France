<h1>Data Analytics Tour de France</h2>

<h3>Final Project of Data Analytics Course at Coderhouse</h3>


<h4> 1. Introduction</h4>
The TDF is an annual multi-stage cycle race that takes place primarily in France. Although occasionally it passes through nearby countries.
It is one of the most watched sports competitions in the world. Broadcast in 180 countries and seen by 3.5 billion people each year.
The Tour was created in 1903 and hardly stopped during the 2 World Wars.

<h4> 2. Objective </h4>
You want to explore the history of TDF from a data perspective.
The idea is to make statements about the runners and about the race in general.

<h4> 3. Scope </h4>
To carry out the study, all the information found from 1930 to 2016 was taken into account.
On October 22, 2012, Lance Armstrong is formally stripped of the seven Tour de France titles he won between 1999 and 2005. He was banned for life from cycling after being found to have used illegal drugs.
For this work, data from those years were not taken into account.

<h4> 4. End user and application level of the analysis. </h4>
It is aimed at the general public, who may not know about the race, and at people who have a notion of it and want to know even more.

<h4> 5. Technological tools implemented. </h4> 
For the present work the following programs were used:
- Excel for reading and cleaning the datasets.
- Draw.io for the creation of the entity-relationship diagram (https://app.diagrams.net).
- Power BI Desktop for the creation of the dashboard.
